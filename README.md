# Machine Learning with Python Libraries

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of popular Python libraries for machine learning, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. It utilizes the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate a classification model to predict passenger survival.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array handling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model building and evaluation

## Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading**
   - The dataset is loaded directly from an online source using Pandas.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dropping unnecessary columns (e.g., Name, Ticket, Cabin)
   - Handling missing values (Age, Embarked)
   - Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)

3. **Data Splitting**
   - Features (X) and target variable (y) are separated.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20%).

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardization is applied using StandardScaler to normalize the feature values.

5. **Model Training**
   - A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the processed dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predictions are made on the test set.
   - Accuracy score and classification report are generated.
   - A confusion matrix is visualized using Seaborn.

## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.

## Results

- The trained model provides predictions on Titanic survival.
- The confusion matrix and classification report evaluate model performance.
- Visualizations help interpret the data and feature importance.

## Future Improvements

- Try different models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Gradient Boosting.
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Experiment with feature engineering techniques.
